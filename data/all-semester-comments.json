He continues to be a leader in the class when it comes to skills, but I would like to see him embrace this leadership role in a way that helps others around him.  He needs to work on the \"team\" concept and realize that in order to be successful he needs to bring the others around him up to his level of skill.  He participates well, but I would like to get more questions from him in regards to how he can improve, as I feel he thinks that he is already the best so he doesnt need to do anything more.
